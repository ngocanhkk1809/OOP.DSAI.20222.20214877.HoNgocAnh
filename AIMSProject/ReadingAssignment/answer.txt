When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. 
For example, in the Media class, you must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). 
If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?

=> If the passing object is not an instance of Media, the equals() method will return false because the comparison can't be performed

Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. 
Observe what happens and explain in detail.

=> When we iterate through the list, the toString() method is called on each Media object. 
The toString() method is dynamically bound. Therefore, for each media object in the list, the appropriate toString() method of each class (Book, DVD, or CompactDisc) is called, and the information of that type is printed.

What class should implement the Comparable interface?
=> The Media class.

In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
=>
public class Media implements Comparable<Media> {
    // Other attributes and methods
    
    public int compareTo(Media other) {
        if (this.cost > other.cost) {
            return 1;
        } else if (this.cost < other.cost) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
    }
}

Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?

=> No

Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?

=> Create another compareTo() method in the DVD class.
