Question: 
If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
JAVA does not allow us to do that since the 2 constructor methods mentioned above have the same number and same type of arguments, hence the constructors cannot be overloaded.
